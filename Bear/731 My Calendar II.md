# 731 My Calendar II
* Problem
	* If the three calendars have the same overlap, then itâ€™s triple booking.
* Solution
	* For the new calendar, see if there is an overlap in overlaps, if there is, it means triple booking.
	* Also find the overlap between the new calendar with other calendars, if there is overlap, means double booking. And if there is another overlap, then triple booking.

        for i, j in self.calendar:
            if start < j and end > i:
